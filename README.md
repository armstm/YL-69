### Arduino Project Solution Soil Moisture Model Soil and Earth YL-69

We will launch the #YL-69 Soil and Soil #Humidometer #Sensor #Module 
using the #Arduino #UNO #board.

In this project, we have used the Arduino UNO board with the #YL-69 
Soil and Soil Humidity Moisture Model and a 16 x 2 #LCD #character to 
display the amount of soil moisture (in percent). In the following, 
the #performance of this project will be explained in more detail.

### Arduino #program :

Note:
To test the project, be sure to start the Arduino board with an adapter 
(the current flow of the Arduino board in the case of a USB cable 
connected to a computer is very low and does not meet some projects).
